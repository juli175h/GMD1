My game for the GMD1 course is going to be a rouge-like 2D topdown shooter, heavily inspired by the game Vampire Survivers. in the game the player starts out pretty weak with a single weapon and can shoot enemies to gather XP. As the player gather more XP they will be able to get stonger by getting more weapons, passive effects or increased stats. I want to change up from Vampire Survives with utalizing the additional buttons on the arcade machine with having weapons that both fire automatically but also some that are activated by a press of a button. 

##Milestole 1
The first milestone would have to be getting the base mechanics in place. Having a charecter that can move around on a map and shoot enemies by firering a single projectile. Additionally, spawning enemies on the map and make them chase the player will also be part of this milestone.

##Milestone 2
The second milestone will be adding at least another weapon that fires splatter on the map where the enemies take damage walking in, an ability that speeds up player significally when pressing on a self chosen button, and an passive ability that makes the player invisible for a short amount of time.

##Milestone 3
Lastly I want to be able to level up the weapons, for example by having multiple projectiles in different directions. Furthermore, the map needs to evolve and get more difficult as the game progress with different kinds of enemies. It will also be important to make sure that the game runs smoothly with a lot of enemies on the screen.

As of right now it's hard to say how elaborate the game is going to be. I am only one person, but I believe that this game easily can adapt to be more limited or evolved, depending on how much time different elements is going to take to develoup.
